# Running Planify

To run this project, you need to run the server and frontend at the same time:

Server: 
### `npm run server`

Frontend:
### `npm start`

You will also need to add your own API key to a .env file â€“ you can simply rename the pre-existing .env.example file and fill in the fields as necessary.
